            <h2>The Road to Enlightenment</h2>
            <p>Back in 2003 (that's 8 years ago!) <a href="http://mezzoblue.com">Dave Shea</a> launched the <a href="http://www.csszengarden.com"><abbr>CSS</abbr> Zen Garden</a>. It showcased what was possible with <abbr>CSS</abbr>-based designs, and that it gave you a complete control over the layout of a page.</p>
            <p>At lot has happened since then, and today you can do almost anything with only CSS. <b>CSS1k</b> invites you to ..</p>

            <h2>So What is This About?</h2>
            <p>Do style sheets really have to be as heave as they are today? The average popular web site <a href="http://httparchive.org/interesting.php#mostcss">has 27k of <abbr>CSS</abbr></a>, but some use up to a megabyte of style sheets!</p>
            <p>Can we acheive awesome things with just 1k of <abbr>CSS</abbr>? I am confident that <em>you</em> can!</p>

            <h2>Rules</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Submissions may be up to 1k (1024 bytes)
                <li>Submissions must consist of only <abbr>CSS</abbr>
                <li>Any and all external resources are strictly forbidden. <code>data</code> <abbr>URI</abbr>:s are OK, but no <code>@import</code>'s or external background images.
                <li>The page <a href="http://dowebsitesneedtolookexactlythesameineverybrowser.com/">does not have to look the same in every browser</a>, but some decent fall backs should be used.
            </ol>
            <p>Download the sample <a href="index.html" title="This page's source HTML code, not to be modified."><abbr>HTML</abbr> file</a> and <a href="default.css" title="This page's sample CSS, the file you may modify."><abbr>CSS</abbr> file</a> to work on a copy locally. Once you have completed your masterpiece (and please, don&#8217;t submit half-finished work) upload your .css file to a web server under your control. <a href="/submit/" title="Use the contact form to send us your CSS file">Send us a link</a> to the file and if we choose to use it, we will spider the associated images. Final submissions will be placed on our server.</span></p>

            <h2>Benefits</h2>
            <p>Why participate? For recognition, inspiration, and a resource we can all refer to when making the case for <abbr>CSS</abbr>-based design. This is sorely needed, even today. More and more major sites are taking the leap, but not enough have. One day this gallery will be a historical curiosity; that day is not today.</p>
